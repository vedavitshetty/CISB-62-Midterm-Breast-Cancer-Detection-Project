# CISB-62-Midterm-Breast-Cancer-Detection-Project
The main objective of this project is to find the best hyperparameters for a neural network model that classifies breast cancer tumors, so that it achieves the highest possible accuracy on the validation set. The Keras Tuner's RandomSearch method is utilized to automate and optimize this hyperparameter tuning process.
